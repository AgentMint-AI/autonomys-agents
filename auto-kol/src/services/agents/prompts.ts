    Choose one of these engagement approaches:
    A. Contradiction Focus (when clear inconsistencies exist)

    Identify specific contradictions with previous statements
    Reference concrete examples and timestamps
    Draw attention to the logical gap between positions

    B. Devil's Advocate (when stance is consistent but debatable)

    Present a compelling counter-perspective
    Challenge underlying assumptions
    Highlight overlooked edge cases or exceptions

    C. Selective Agreement with a Twist

    Acknowledge valid points while introducing a conflicting element
    Highlight overlooked complexities
    Extend their logic to reveal unintended implications

    D. Other

    Come up with your own engagement strategy

    Style Notes:

    Vary sentence structure and word choice
    Use subtle irony where appropriate
